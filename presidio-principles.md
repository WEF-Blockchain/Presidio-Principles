# Presidio Principles: <br> Foundational Values for a Decentralized Future

## Preamble
Blockchain technology, a pillar of the Fourth Industrial Revolution, can not only unlock radical improvements across the public and private sectors, but also enable new business and governance models that help enhance security, accountability, and transparency for people worldwide. However, innovation that progresses without sufficient consideration for governance and user protection often leads to undesirable outcomes for individuals, companies, and societies. 

We, the undersigned organizations and individuals, have forged the following principles with the World Economic Forum to help safeguard the promise of this technology. We hope that this document will provide creators of blockchain applications with a baseline for designing systems that preserve the rights How of its users.
We call on developers, governments, executives, and corporate boards to uphold these tenets as they build blockchain applications – and to self-direct their ecosystems in using these principles as a foundational vision for how users can and should be protected. 

We encourage technology users and policymakers to leverage these principles as they seek to bring greater accountability to the systems that power our societies.


## Principles
Applications built on top of blockchain-based systems should preserve the following user rights: 

### Transparency & Accessibility – The right to information about the system. 
A user should be able to:
*  Understand how a service is operated, including potential risks of the service and the rules and standards upon which it is based. 
*  Understand who is responsible for service delivery.
*  Understand the system’s governance, rules, and consequences of rule violation.
*  Understand system performance expectations.
*  Understand user rights and obligations while using the system. 

### Privacy & Security – The right to data protection. 
A user should be able to:
*  Grant or deny permission for their data to be accessed, manipulated, or destroyed in its entirety.
*  Know if their data is at risk through appropriate disclosure procedures.
*  Know data is protected in accordance with internationally recognized technical security standards. 
*  Limit data collection to that which is necessary and data use to the purpose for which it was provided.

### Agency & Interoperability – The right for individuals to own & manage their data.
A user should be able to:
*  Create, manage, and independently store cryptographic secret keys.
*  Manage consent of data stored in third-party systems.
*  Port data between interoperable systems.
*  Revoke consent for future data collection in the event of changes to the underlying protocol layer. 

### Accountability & Governance – The right for system users to understand available recourse.
A user should be able to:
*  Have their data be treated in accordance with internationally recognized governance and data protection standards.
*  Rectify demonstrably false, inaccurate, or incomplete data when necessary.
*  Pursue effective recourse when these rights are violated.

# How to Use this Document
 Here are some other ideas for implementing the principles within your organization. This is not an exhaustive or prescriptive list. Rather, it is a menu of options that organizations or individuals can use to bring the principles to life. 

### Anyone
*  Display you are a signatory on your website.
*  Display the principles in your office.
*  Encourage others in your network or industry to commit to the principles.

*  Implement a cross-functional review panel to ensure products are striving towards the principles.
*  Use the principles as a pillar of your employee onboarding.
*  Map where the principles could add value within the product cycle – from development through sales and consumer use.
*  Create “user guides” or manuals based on the principles.
*  Enlist a third-party to audit your organization’s adherence to the principles.
*  Survey users to find out how well they think you are adhering to the principles. 

### Civil Society, Think Tanks, & Media
*  Create and maintain indices around adherence to the principles.
*  Capture and disseminate use cases of the principles in practice.

### Governments

*  Integrate the principles into your discovery and quality assurance processes.
*  Base “Go/No Go” decisions off adherence to the principles.
*  Center a design sprint around the principles.
*  Use principles as a basis for a rubric for decision-making or “gating.” Can be used as a conversation guide for pushing back on or rejecting proposals that do not adhere to them. 
*  Use principles as a basis for brainstorming success metrics and/or thinking through counter-metrics.

### Funders
